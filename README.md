# A Cheat for DOOM Eternal *(Steam version)*, written in C++.

## Installation
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/cragson/doom-eternal-cheat.git
```

## Features

- Infinite Ammo
  - Infinite Ammo, grenades, chainsaw fuel and a lot more.
- God mode
  - Only works for every entity, so to be able to kill enemies, you have to chainsaw them or use weapon mods.
- Free Upgrades
  - Upgrades will not lower your points but increase them. So you just need enough resources for the first upgrade.

## Maintenance, future updates and compatibility

- This cheat uses signatures for the features, so it will work for future updates as long as the signatures are not corrupted.
- I only tested the cheat on the *steam version* of DOOM Eternal!

## Based on

- [osmium](https://github.com/cragson/osmium) - This cheat is based on my own Framework for external cheats.
